621," within this brief is that the applicable law or regulation is overly broad and should not be enforced as it stands due to these constitutional issues.Yasmin Hermione Arslan presents this legal brief in support of the argument that the current law or regulation in question is unconstitutional. This argument is based on the fact that the law or regulation in question does not provide sufficient protection against potential infringements of constitutional rights. The current law or regulation is overly broad in scope and is not narrowly tailored to the established purpose for which it was enacted, thus overstepping the bounds of the respective authority under which it was put into effect.Furthermore, the law or regulation in question not only fails to address the issue of potential constitutional violations, it also creates an undue burden on those seeking to enjoy the full protections of their constitutional rights. In asking the appropriate judicial body to review this legal argument, Yasmin Hermione Arslan seeks to demonstrate clearly how the current law or regulation is in violation of established constitutional precedent and should not be enforced in its current form.
