They giggled as they chased each other, venturing over uneven ground, through puddles, and beneath branches. Although they had never met before this day, their friendship flourished in these shared memories, creating a bond unlike any other.

" enacted to ensure that those with criminal records are kept out of the country.Carlos Hernandez arrived in the U.S. several years ago looking for a better future for himself and his family. Although he was prepared to take the legal route and apply for an entry permit, he quickly became discouraged with the complicated, costly, and lengthy process. With no clear pathway into the country and facing a mounting financial burden, he was left with no other choice but to cross the border illegally. Unfortunately, Carlos is not alone. As America’s immigration system has become more broken, vast numbers of people have been entering the country illegally or overstaying their visas in order to survive. This trend needs to be reversed in order to create a safe and orderly environment in which people can feel secure in their entry into the United States. Comprehensive reforms are needed to ensure that laws are upheld, that illegal immigration is reduced, and that immigrants are treated fairly and are held to the same standards as citizens. Reforming the nation’s immigration system is essential to providing clarity and predictability to both immigrants and the government.
